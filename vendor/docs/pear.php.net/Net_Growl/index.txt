== Introduction

Until now there were many UDP PHP implementations, but none for the new
http://www.growlforwindows.com/gfw/help/gntp.aspx[Growl
Notification Transport Protocol (GNTP) - v1.0]

I've decided to enlarge work begun by Bertrand Mansion with the
http://pear.php.net/package/Net_Growl[PEAR::Net_Growl] package (v 0.7.0).

While you can find some old compatible PHP4 versions (0.8.0b1, 0.9.0b1, 0.9.0b2),
I've decided, with final stable version 2.0.0, to drop support of PHP4.

I'm focus now on a unique PHP5 library that includes all features of GNTP 1.0


== Overview

Net_Growl provides :

.Ability to use both protocol UDP and GNTP

UDP is limited to some features :

* Application and notification icons are not provided by PHP scripts.
* Callbacks are not supported.

GNTP is better than UDP :

* Application and notification icons may be provided by PHP scripts.
* Callbacks may be supported. (not yet with Net_Growl beta1)
* Different Hash and Encryption backend : MD5, SHA1 (for version 0.9.0b1)
plus SHA256 and SHA512 (for version 2.0.0b1)

.Ability to log messages sent and received to Growl

Log framework used with version 0.9.0b1 is
http://pear.php.net/package/Log[PEAR::Log] package.
While versions since 2.0.0b1 uses no particular log framework
(basic text file I/O).

.Ability to auto register before sending notification

Both versions may send notifications without to call the Net_Growl::register()
function. Net_Growl will do it for you at first notification.

.Ability to display default Growl Logo

If Application and Notification icons are invalid or not reachable,
Net_Growl display the default Growl Logo.
